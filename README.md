This Project used the GIPHY API to pull gifs based on user input. 

Using jQuery functions, the user can input a number to get a specific amount of results. Multiple searches can be done without the need to refresh the page.

Uses HTML, CSS, SCSS, Javascript, jQuery.

Improvement ideas:
Adding other pages for the navbar links.
Adding additional APIs to make Image results as well as GIFs
Footer Icon could fit better with the color scheme
